### Financial fun for the whole family, if your family happen to be monsters

#### Current Version: 3.2.1
## Overview
This was a follow-up to the other one. Except this is better in every single way. Find it here: http://troligarchmarkets.ga

The stylesheets are done through Bluma, which is why they look so... not utterly junk. The database is MySQL which is far, far, far better than csves.

## Version Numbering
I've decided on the world's most convoluted version numbering.

Version Number Example - 1.0.1

First digit - __1__.0.1 - This signifies big changes, stuff like adding bonds, loans, tax filings. You know, the big stuff.

Second digit - 1.__0__.1 - This signifies medium changes that could have been lumped in a bigger one, but weren't. Things like letting people view their holdings, admin page updates that don't concern the likes of you, that kinda thing.

Third digit - 1.0.__1__ - This signifies small changes, glorified bug fixes. Stuff like adding the VAT to Rishi and that. If you see an update here, don't bother.
